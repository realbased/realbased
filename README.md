I am a pentesting student, i started my coding carrer with building discord bots and python malwares for educational purposes only.
I have a little bit of experience with javascript, nodejs, lua, SQL and some more.. but i dont think i know enough to just claim that i know how to code in it
but im pretty sure that if you tell me to do something in any language, i can do it.
This is my github profile where i will just post my projects and see what people think of it.
